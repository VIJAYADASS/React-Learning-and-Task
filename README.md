# React-Learning-and-Task
# Day 1

Create Two Components one is a Function Component and the other is a Class Component.
# Task: Creating Class and Functional Counter in React.
Objective: Create two React components: one using a class-based approach and the other using a functional approach. Both components should display a counter that can be incremented by clicking a button.
# Requirements:
1. Create a class component called ClassCounter.
2. Create a functional component called FunctionCounter.
3. Both components should display a counter and a button to increment the counter.
4. Use state management to handle the counter value.
5. Ensure the components are reusable and can be imported into another Component.

# Day 2

Passing and Displaying Props in React.
#Task: Create props using Parent and Child components in React.
Objective: Create a parent component that passes data as props to a child component. The child component should display the received props in a structured format.
# Requirements:
1. Create a parent component called ParentComponent.
2. Create a child component called ChildComponent.
3. The ParentComponent should pass the following data as props to the ChildComponent.
   1. Name,
   2. Age,
   3. Email
5. The ChildComponent should display the received data in a readable format.

# Day-03

Create the use state hook
# Task:
Create a simple counter application using React's useState hook. The application should display the current count and have three buttons: one to increment the count, one to decrease the count, and one to reset the count to zero. Implement the functionality so that clicking each button updates the displayed count appropriately.

Requirements:
1. Display the current count.
2. Provide three buttons:
   1. Increment,
   2. Decrement,
   3. Reset.
4. Clicking the Increment button should increase the count by 1.
5. Clicking the Decrement button should decrease the count by 1.
6. Clicking the Reset button should set the count back to 0.

# Day-04
Learned the use of effects hook in React.
# Task one:
Create a simple React component that fetches data from an API when the component mounts. Display the fetched data in a list.

# Requirements:
1. Use the use effect hook to perform the data fetching when the component mounts.
2. Use the use state hook to store the fetched data.
3. Display the data in a list format.
4. Ensure proper error handling if the fetch request fails.
API Endpoint: You can use a public API endpoint like https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts to fetch data.

# Task Two:
Countdown Timer using use effect
Create a simple countdown timer component in React. The timer should start from a given number of seconds and count down to zero. When the timer reaches zero, display a message "Time's up!.

# Requirements:
1. Use the use state hook to manage the timer state.
2. Use the use effect hook to handle the countdown logic.
3. The countdown should decrease by 1 every second.
4. Display the remaining time.
5. When the timer reaches zero, display "Time's up!".
# Bonus:
Add a start and reset button to control the timer.
